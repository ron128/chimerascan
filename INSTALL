===================
System Requirements
===================

Python 2.6+
===========
chimerascan requires python version 2.6 or higher (http://python.org)

Pysam
=====
chimerascan is bundled with the Pysam library for interacting with files
in the SAM format. Please visit (http://code.google.com/p/pysam/) for
more information on this tool.

SAMtools depends on the zlib library <http://www.zlib.net>. The latest 
version 1.2.3 is preferred and with the latest version you can compile 
razip and use it to compress a FASTA file. SAMtools' faidx is able to 
index a razip-compressed FASTA file to save diskspace. Older zlib also 
works with SAMtools, but razip cannot be compiled.

The text-based viewer (tview) requires the GNU ncurses library
<http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/>, which comes with Mac OS X and
most of the modern Linux/Unix distributions. If you do not have this
library installed, you can still compile the rest of SAMtools by
manually modifying one line in Makefile.

Pysam requires pyrex (0.9.8 or greater) and python (2.6 or greater).
It has not been tested on many other platforms.

Bowtie
======
You must have a working bowtie installation to run chimerascan.  The
current distribution of chimerascan has been tested with bowtie 0.12.7.
Please visit (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) for 
instructions on downloading and installing bowtie.

Compilation
===========

Unpack the distribution and enter the chimerascan directory. Type 

python setup.py build

to compile.


Installation
============

Type 

   python setup.py install

to install it within the site-packages directory of your python
distribution. Type

   python setup.py install --help 

for more options.

Architecture specific options
=============================

chimerascan has been compiled on and tested on 64-bit RedHat Enterprise
Linux 5 systems using python 2.6.  Testing on other Linux distributions
is pending.
